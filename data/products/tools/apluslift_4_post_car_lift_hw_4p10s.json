The design of the car lift model is time tested for 30 years. It is an extra long, extra wide, and extra tall car lift model. It is built with quality materials and good workmanship and is powder coated for superior corrosion resistance. The car lift uses a revolutionary high efficient 110V 3HP hydraulic power unit to make car lift operation much safer. The auto hoist is best for parking/storage/service use by homeowners or restoration shops.</h3>\n<h3>APlusLift HW-4P10S 4-post car auto lift truck hoist package includes a caster kit with polyurethane wheels, a jack tray, three drip trays, two removable approach ramps and a power cord. The caster kit allows customers to move the lift around the garage easily and can be installed or removed in minutes. The jack tray allows customers to use a jack to lift one end of the vehicle. The drip trays prevent fluid from the top vehicle from dripping onto the bottom vehicle. Optional sliding jacks are available for purchase.</h3>\n<h3>Free shipping to lower 48 states with forklift (or similar) on-site, or free pickup at nearby terminal. Car lifts require on-site forklift (no liftgate). We strongly recommend against renting a forklift; expense not reimbursed. See shipping policy below for limited access/remote/high-cost areas.</h3>\n<h3>Warehouse Pickup Locations (<span style=\"color: red;\" color=\"red\">Contact Us for $400 Discount</span>): Franklin (IN).</h3>\n<h3>Frequently Asked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apluslift.com/pages/product-order-and-shipping-questions\">Product, Order, and Shipping Questions</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apluslift.com/pages/troubleshooting-questions#8s\">Technical Questions</a>\n</h3>\n<h3>Specifications and Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><u><a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1751/1741/files/APlusLift_HW-4P10S.pdf\">Installation Manual</a></u></li>\n<li>3 Years (36 Months) Warranty</li>\n<li>Lifting Capacity: 10,000LB</li>\n<li>Usage: Parking/Storage/Service</li>\n<li>Powder Coated Finish with Superior Corrosion Resistance</li>\n<li>Caster Kit, Jack Tray, 3 Drip Trays, And 2 Removable Approach Ramps Included</li>\n<li>Heavy duty 7/16\" diameter cables that reduce high stress on synchronization process and increase cable life</li>\n<li>Overall Length: 234\"</li>\n<li>Overall Width: 136\"</li>\n<li>Overall Height: 98\"</li>\n<li>Lifting Height: 83 1/16\"</li>\n<li>Clearance Under Runway: 78\"</li>\n<li>Drive Through Width: 112\"</li>\n<li>Runway Size: 192 15/16\"L x 21 1/16\"W</li>\n<li>Width Between Runways: 37 5/8\" Inside-Inside, 79 3/4\" Outside-Outside</li>\n<li>Runway Gauge Steel: 4</li>\n<li>Column Cross Section: 6 5/16\"L x 4 5/16\"W</li>\n<li>Removable Approach Ramps Size: 36 7/16\"L x 21 1/16\"W</li>\n<li>Lock Positions:&nbsp;21</li>\n<li>Lifting Time: 80 seconds</li>\n<li>Motor: 110V Single Phase 3HP 10A (recommend a 30A breaker)</li>\n<li>Powercord: 10ft</li>\n<li>Hydraulic Oil: 3-5 gallons AW32/AW46 (Not Included in the Package)</li>\n<li>Concrete Thickness: 4\"</li>\n<li>Shipping Weight: 2,500LB</li>\n<li>Shipping package size: 200\"L x 25\"W x 28\"H</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a href=\"/collections/4-post-parking-and-alignment-lifts\">All 4-Post Lifts and Jacks.</a></h2>",
