  "body_html": "<p>Go deeper into the groundbreaking Emmy-winning series with the complete, authorized scripts of <em>Stranger Things</em>: Season One, including an exclusive introduction from the Duffer Brothers.  A high-pitched shrieking sound suddenly fills the shed. We don't see what happens to Will; we just watch that naked dangling light bulb. It glows brighter and brighter and brighter, filling the shed with overwhelming white light. We think the glass of the bulb is going to shatter but then — The terrible shrieking sound abruptly stops. The bulb dims. Returning to normal wattage. We pull away from the light. The shed is empty. Will has vanished.  When young Will Byers disappears, the sleepy little town of Hawkins, Indiana, is awakened to a mystery involving secret experiments, terrifying supernatural forces, and a strange little girl with a tattoo of the number eleven on her arm . . . and the ability to move objects with her mind.  The Duffer Brothers' critically acclaimed series, <em>Stranger Things</em>, took the world by storm with its 80s nostalgia, dimension-hopping secrets, and charming cast of characters. Season One introduced us to our favorite friend squad—Mike, Dustin, Lucas, and Will—plus their new Eggo-loving friend, El, and to the terrifying \"Upside Down,\" an evil alternate dimension with a species of humanoid predators roaming the landscape.  Collected here for the first time, the complete scripts of <em>Stranger Things</em>: Season One include the scenes, dialogue, and character directions for all eight episodes as well as an exclusive introduction from the creators and showrunners, Matt and Ross Duffer. Season One's scripts reveal a unique insight into the foundational story that immediately captivated viewers and popular culture.</p><ul>\n<li>Format: Paperback </li>\n<li>      Pages: 496 </li>\n<li>      Author: The Duffer Brothers, Netflix</li>\n</ul>",
