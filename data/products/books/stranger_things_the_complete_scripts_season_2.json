  "body_html": "<p>Go deeper into the groundbreaking Emmy-winning series with the complete, authorized scripts of <em>Stranger Things</em>: Season Two, including an exclusive introduction from the Duffer Brothers.  EXT. DOWNTOWN HAWKINS - THE PALACE (THE UPSIDE DOWN) Will steps outside. Scared. Cautious. It's a very familiar nightmare landscape. Fog. Spores. Nether growths. Only. . . it's worse now. The spores are heavier; the growths, thicker, smothering the buildings. If the Upside Down is a supernatural cancer . . . then that cancer has spread.  Nearly a year after the Demogorgon attacked Hawkins and Eleven sacrificed herself to save her friends, life has largely returned to normal for everyone. Mike and his friends are competing for high scores at the new arcade. Hopper is dealing with locals complaining about rotting crops. And Joyce is dating super nice guy, Bob. But Will is still being plagued with terrifying visions of the Upside Down, and the rot affecting local crops is spreading . . . and stemming from Hawkins Lab.  The Duffer Brothers' critically acclaimed series, <em>Stranger Things</em>, took the world by storm with its 80s nostalgia, dimension-hopping secrets, and charming cast of characters. Season Two brings a cool new kid Max and her jerk brother, Billy, to Hawkins along with TV dinners for El and Hopper; Bob's heroics; the cute-but-suddenly-not-cute demodogs; and the terrifying Mind Flayer.  Collected here for the first time, the complete scripts of <em>Stranger Things</em>: Season Two include the scenes, dialogue, and character directions for all nine episodes as well as an exclusive introduction from the creators and showrunners, Matt and Ross Duffer.</p><ul>\n<li>Format: Paperback </li>\n<li>        Pages: 624 </li>\n<li>       Author: The Duffer Brothers, Netflix</li>\n</ul>",
